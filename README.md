# Heart Health Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset containing demographics, vital signs, and markers for heart disease risk among individuals. It includes data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, exercise habits, smoking status, and instances of heart attacks. Statistical analysis and machine learning models are applied to understand cardiovascular health factors and predict heart attack risk.

## Project Overview
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

## Data Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
Preprocess categorical variables like gender and smoker status.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Calculate descriptive statistics for numeric features (age, height, weight, cholesterol, glucose, exercise hours).
Visualize data distributions, correlations, and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.

Statistical Analysis:
Conduct t-tests to compare cholesterol levels between genders, exercise hours between genders, and glucose levels between smokers and non-smokers.
Calculate confidence intervals for heart attack proportions in the population and among smokers vs. non-smokers.
Machine Learning Modeling:

## Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train various classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting).
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
